## About Me

My background is in theoretical physics, with a Ph.D. from Princeton University where I worked on computational particle physics.

For the past thirty years, I have been a Senior Computer Specialist and the Linux Guru for the Physics and Astronomy departments at the University of Washington (Seattle), entrusted with the care and feeding of the departmentsâ€™ Unix/Linux workstations and servers.

I plan on using GitHub to share the various software tools I've created over the years.
